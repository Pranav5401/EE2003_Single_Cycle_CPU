# EE2003_Single_Cycle_CPU
Implementation of Single Cycle CPU in verilog

As part of course assignment, had to write the cpu module which is connected to the other modules like dmem and imem.
It takes idata as input ( from instruction memory ).
The goal is to implement a single cycle cpu using this as input and doing the correct operation by checking the opcode instructions.
